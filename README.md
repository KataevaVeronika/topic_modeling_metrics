# Neural network methods for evaluating topic models

The work is dedicated to overcoming the difficulty of topic model assessment with the development of new neural network methods. Experimentation is conducted with BigARTM model.

The current work focuses on:
- data parsing;
- creation of a pipeline for text processing;
- creation of a pipeline for topic modeling;
- assessment of topic modeling quality (Coherence, PMI, NPMI, Topic Significance, SwitchP, BigARTM metrics).
